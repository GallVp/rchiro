\title{Calculate Over dispersion for a Model}
\usage{
overdisp_fun(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object from which to calculate overdispersion.
This function is typically used with models such as generalized linear
models (\code{glm}) or other types of models where residuals and degrees of
freedom can be computed.}
}
\value{
A named vector containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{chisq}: Pearson's chi-squared statistic.
\item \code{ratio}: Ratio of the chi-squared statistic to the residual
degrees of freedom.
\item \code{rdf}: Residual degrees of freedom of the model.
\item \code{p}: p-value for the chi-squared statistic.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates a measure of overdispersion for a fitted model.
Overdispersion is assessed using Pearson's chi-squared statistic, which
compares the observed and expected values of residuals. This is particularly
useful for evaluating models fitted to count data or other types of data
where overdispersion might be a concern.
}
\details{
The function computes Pearson's chi-squared statistic from the
Pearson residuals of the model and then calculates the ratio of this
statistic to the residual degrees of freedom. A large ratio indicates
potential overdispersion.

# Fit a generalized linear model
model <- glm(cbind(successes, failures) ~ predictor,
  family = binomial,
  data = example_data
)
# Calculate overdispersion
