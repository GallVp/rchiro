\title{Create a Factor with Custom Levels and Labels}
\usage{
make.factor(Data.vector, levels, labels, explicit.na = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data.vector}{A vector to be converted into a factor.}

\item{levels}{A vector of levels to be assigned to the factor.}

\item{labels}{A vector of labels corresponding to the levels.}

\item{explicit.na}{Logical, indicating whether missing values (NA) should
be explicitly assigned to a "Missing" level. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A factor with specified levels and labels, potentially including
an explicit "Missing" level for NA values.
}
\description{
This function transforms a vector into a factor, assigns specified levels
and labels, and optionally handles missing values by explicitly assigning
them a level.
}
\details{
This function allows for the creation of factors from a vector while
specifying both levels and labels.
If \code{explicit.na} is set to \code{TRUE}, missing values are explicitly
assigned to a level named "Missing".
The function also drops any unused levels from the factor.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
vec <- c("low", "medium", "high", NA, "low")
levels <- c("low", "medium", "high")
labels <- c("Low", "Medium", "High")
make.factor(vec, levels, labels)
}
