\title{Compute Confidence Intervals for Fixed Effects in a Linear Mixed Model}
\usage{
\method{confint}{rlmerMod}(object, parm, level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted linear mixed-effects model object of class
\code{rlmerMod}. This is typically created using the \code{rlmer} function from
the \code{rstanarm} package.}

\item{parm}{A character vector specifying which parameters (fixed effects)
to compute confidence intervals for. If missing, confidence intervals for
all fixed effects are computed.}

\item{level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence
level for the intervals. The default is 0.95 for 95\% confidence intervals.}
}
\value{
A matrix of confidence intervals for the specified fixed effects.
Each row corresponds to a fixed effect, with columns representing the lower
and upper bounds of the confidence intervals.
}
\description{
This function calculates confidence intervals for the fixed effects of a
fitted linear mixed-effects model (of class \code{rlmerMod}). The intervals are
computed based on the estimated coefficients and their standard errors using
a normal distribution.
}
\examples{
library(rstanarm)
# Fit a linear mixed-effects model
mod <- rlmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), data = sleepstudy)
# Compute 95\% confidence intervals for all fixed effects
confint.rlmerMod(mod)
# Compute 99\% confidence intervals for specific parameters
confint.rlmerMod(mod, parm = "Days", level = 0.99)
}
